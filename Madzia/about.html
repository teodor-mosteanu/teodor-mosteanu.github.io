            <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:180%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-family:"Lato",sans-serif;'>Easy As Pie is a research project posing questions of food and food storytelling as mediators for cross-cultural contact and communication. By employing theatrical approaches and methods, three creative workshops were designed and took place in July 2019 at the Museum of English Rural Life in Reading.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:180%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-family:"Lato",sans-serif;'>The aim of the project was to engage the participants (Reading community members) in devising and sharing stories related to food and migration whilst introducing in the creative process the MERL&rsquo;s collections and facilities. As a result, participants explored the museum&rsquo;s exhibition as well as the herbal garden and an original kitchen space of the building and draw inspiration from the spatial setting, sounds and objects of the museum. Some of the stories written by participants were then shared in the studio, herbal garden and some in the shepherds hut &ndash; each places carefully chosen by participants in collaboration with facilitators in order to enhance the storytelling.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:180%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-family:"Lato",sans-serif;'>As part of the workshop, participants were introduced and lead through the psycho-physical warm-up practices of theatre-making such as breathing techniques, mindfulness and movement exercises. With a help from the creative team free-writing tasks were practiced and ideas for storylines generated. Musician Jack Webb provided musical score for the stories as well as the background music for the devising exercises that took place in the Studio.</span></p>

Tom has attended one of the Easy as Pie workshops and documented the day in drawings which is displayed along with the audio narratives and in the Documentation Gallery.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:180%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-family:"Lato",sans-serif;'>Easy As Pie Storytelling is dedicated to a wider audience of those who have experienced migration directly or indirectly. Through the sharing of stories, community members are given the voice and offer an invaluable insight into a complex experience of migration, searching for one&rsquo;s home and belonging. The Easy As Pie storytelling installation is key to reach out to our audiences and migrant communities in UK and beyond. The website is also offering transparency of the research methodology for the academic audience who is interested in theatre and migration studies.</span></p>

        Methodology

    <article class="text-information">
        <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:10.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><strong><span style='font-family:"Lato",sans-serif;'>Creative writing by Lauren Morley</span></strong></p>
        <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:10.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:180%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-family:"Lato",sans-serif;'>The objective of writing exercises was to get participants engaged with their senses, guiding them through a broad brainstorming of memories that would eventually become a single, complete story. The timing of these exercises was participant-led; I had a rough guideline of how much time should be allotted to each exercise, but if participants needed more or less time, it would be accommodated.</span></p>
        <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:180%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-family:"Lato",sans-serif;'>The participants were asked to brainstorm, rapidly, 5 things that came to mind when thinking of home for each of the 5 senses. They were then asked to choose one idea that jumped out to them for each sense. <br> <br> Next, the participants were asked to brainstorm ten family legends --stories from home that are told around the dinner table, these anecdotes that get passed on and told to friends and partners and younger family members. <br> <br> In the discussion, we began to connect these legends to food. Did many of them involve food? Did they not? What was the significance if so?<br> <br> We then moved on to brainstorming what I like to call &quot;Ratatouille&quot; moments --tasting a food that brings you immediately into a memory, like when the curmudgeonly critic Anton Ego is transported to his childhood by a taste of Confit Biyaldi in the film Ratatouille. We discussed crossover between any of these moments and any food-related family legends. <br> <br> The purpose of these warmup exercises was to connect sense memory with story. At this point I gave the participants ten minutes to choose one of their family legends to write out in long form. Some of them had been discussed around the table beforehand. Participants were encouraged to share their stories, and we helped identify a beginning, a middle and an end. <br> <br>&nbsp;The stories were then ready for dramatisation and dramaturgy. For my part, I encouraged participants to find the structure they wanted for their story. I asked where the conflicts were, who else was involved? What did things look like? Smell like? Sound like? When people they know tell the story, what do they focus on? Again, this process was participant-led, as I wanted to encourage the participants to find the story that they wanted to tell, and find the words that best suited what they wanted to express.</span></p>

Here I directed and performed in plays, ran writing and improv masterclasses, and arranged for college members to attend great theatre performances all across London.<br> <br> Prior to moving to London, I spent 23 years in Ottawa involved in the theatre and performance community there. I hold an Honours BA from the University of Ottawa in Communication, Theatre and Film studies, and have performed at Canada&rsquo;s National Arts Centre with Opera Lyra and the Ottawa Children&rsquo;s Choir, the University of Ottawa&rsquo;s Academic Hall, and the Youth InFringement Festival.<br> <br> I am a grateful graduate of the Arts Canterbury Literary Arts Programme one of Canada&rsquo;s top secondary schools for the arts. This programme was the foundation of my skills as a writer, allowed me to apply my writing across many artistic disciplines, and fed my hunger for a close-knit and collaborative group that works every day to help each other be the best that they can be.<br> <br> Most recently, I was a member of the 2017-2018 the Soho Writers Alumni Group after completing a year with the Soho Theatre Young Company Writer&rsquo;s Lab in 2016-17.
